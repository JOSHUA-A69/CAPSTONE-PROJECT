# Priest Assignment Notification System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete notification system for priests when admins assign them to reservations. The system includes in-app notifications, email notifications, and a dedicated notification interface for priests.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Admin Side - Assignment Form**

**File**: `resources/views/admin/notifications/priest-declined.blade.php`

‚úÖ **"Send Assignment" Button**

-   Changed button text from "Assign Priest" to "Send Assignment"
-   Added mail/envelope icon to indicate notification will be sent
-   Form submits to `admin.reservations.assign-priest` route
-   Includes priest dropdown (with availability indicators)
-   Optional remarks field for admin to add notes

**Features**:

```blade
<button type="submit" class="...bg-purple-600...">
    <svg><!-- Mail icon --></svg>
    Send Assignment
</button>
```

### 2. **Priest Notification Service**

**File**: `app/Services/ReservationNotificationService.php`

‚úÖ **Updated `notifyPriestAssigned()` Method**

-   Creates in-app notification for the assigned priest
-   Sends email notification (already existed)
-   Sends SMS notification (if phone number available)
-   Stores notification data in JSON format

**In-App Notification Created**:

```php
Notification::create([
    'user_id' => $priest_id,
    'reservation_id' => $reservation_id,
    'message' => 'You have been assigned to officiate...',
    'type' => 'Assignment',
    'sent_at' => now(),
    'data' => [
        'service_name' => '...',
        'requestor_name' => '...',
        'schedule_date' => '...',
        'venue' => '...',
        'admin_remarks' => '...'
    ]
]);
```

### 3. **Priest Notification Controller**

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Priest/NotificationController.php`

‚úÖ **New Controller Created** with methods:

-   `getUnreadCount()` - Returns JSON count for badge
-   `getRecent()` - Returns HTML for dropdown (last 5 notifications)
-   `index()` - Lists all notifications (paginated)
-   `show()` - Redirects to appropriate view based on type
-   `showAssignment()` - Displays assignment notification detail
-   `markAsRead()` - Marks single notification as read
-   `markAllAsRead()` - Marks all notifications as read

### 4. **Priest Notification Routes**

**File**: `routes/web.php`

‚úÖ **Added 7 Routes** under `priest.` prefix:

```php
GET  /priest/notifications                      - priest.notifications.index
GET  /priest/notifications/count                - priest.notifications.count
GET  /priest/notifications/recent               - priest.notifications.recent
GET  /priest/notifications/{id}/assignment      - priest.notifications.assignment
GET  /priest/notifications/{id}                 - priest.notifications.show
POST /priest/notifications/{id}/mark-read       - priest.notifications.mark-read
POST /priest/notifications/mark-all-read        - priest.notifications.mark-all-read
```

### 5. **Navigation Bell for Priests**

**File**: `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`

‚úÖ **Updated Navigation** to include priests:

-   Changed condition from `['admin', 'staff']` to `['admin', 'staff', 'priest']`
-   Added conditional routing based on role
-   Priests see their own notification routes
-   Badge shows unread count with red indicator
-   Dropdown shows last 5 notifications
-   Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

**Role-Based Routes**:

```php
@if(auth()->user()->role === 'priest')
    fetch('{{ route('priest.notifications.recent') }}')
@else
    fetch('{{ route('admin.notifications.recent') }}')
@endif
```

### 6. **Priest Notification Views**

#### **Index View** (`resources/views/priest/notifications/index.blade.php`)

‚úÖ Lists all notifications with:

-   Type badges (Assignment, Update, System Alert)
-   Unread indicators (blue dot + "New" label)
-   Message content
-   Time ago (e.g., "2 hours ago")
-   Action buttons (View Details, View Reservation)
-   Pagination
-   Empty state for no notifications

‚úÖ Detailed assignment notification page with:
