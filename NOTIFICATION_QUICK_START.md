```bash
# Check if notifications exist
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\Notification::count()
>>> App\Models\Notification::whereNull('read_at')->count()
```

### Issue: Dropdown shows "Loading..."

**Solution:**

-   Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Routes not found

**Solution:**

```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Issue: Migration fails

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if database is running
php artisan migrate:status

# If already migrated:
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
php artisan migrate
```

## üìä Verification Queries

Check database after test:

```sql
-- Check notifications created
SELECT * FROM notifications
WHERE type = 'Priest Declined'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check unread count for admin
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM notifications
WHERE user_id = [ADMIN_USER_ID]
AND read_at IS NULL;

-- Check notification data
SELECT
  notification_id,
  user_id,
  reservation_id,
  message,
  type,
  data,
  read_at,
  sent_at
FROM notifications
WHERE type = 'Priest Declined';
```
