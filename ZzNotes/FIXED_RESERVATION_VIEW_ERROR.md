# ✅ FIXED: Staff Reservation View Error

## The Error

**Problem:** When clicking "View" on any reservation in the staff reservations page, you got:

```
Attempt to read property "email" on null
```

**Location:** Line 78 in `resources/views/staff/reservations/show.blade.php`

---

## Root Cause

The history section was trying to access `$h->user` but:

1. The correct relationship is `$h->performedBy` (not `user`)
2. Some history records might not have a user assigned (system actions)
3. The code wasn't handling null values safely

---

## The Fix

### **Changed:**

```blade
<!-- OLD (BROKEN) -->
<p class="text-xs text-gray-600">
    by {{ $h->user->full_name ?? $h->user->email }}
    on {{ $h->created_at->format('Y-m-d H:i') }}
</p>
```

### **To:**

```blade
<!-- NEW (FIXED) -->
<p class="text-xs text-gray-600">
    by {{ $h->performedBy?->full_name ?? $h->performedBy?->email ?? 'System' }}
    on {{ $h->created_at->format('Y-m-d H:i') }}
</p>
```

### **What Changed:**

1. ✅ `$h->user` → `$h->performedBy` (correct relationship)
2. ✅ Added `?->` (null-safe operator) to prevent errors
3. ✅ Added fallback to `'System'` if no user exists

---

## Test It Now

1. **Refresh your browser:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Go to:** http://localhost:8000/staff/reservations
3. **Click "View"** on any reservation
4. **It should work now!** ✅

The history section will now show:

-   User's full name (if available)
-   Or user's email (if no full name)
-   Or "System" (if no user assigned)

---

## What This Section Shows

The **History** section displays all actions performed on a reservation:

**Example:**

```
History
─────────────────────────
Pending adviser approval
by mark galimba on 2025-10-18 10:52

Submitted
by System on 2025-10-18 10:52
```

Each entry shows:

-   **Action:** What happened (submitted, approved, rejected, etc.)
-   **Performed by:** Who did it (or "System" for automated actions)
-   **When:** Date and time
-   **Remarks:** Optional notes

---

## Files Modified

✅ `resources/views/staff/reservations/show.blade.php` - Fixed history user display
✅ View cache cleared

---

## Related Fix

This works together with the `performedBy()` relationship we added earlier to `app/Models/ReservationHistory.php`:

```php
public function performedBy()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'performed_by', 'id');
}
```

---

## Why Use `?->` (Null-Safe Operator)

The `?->` operator in PHP 8.0+ prevents errors when accessing properties on null objects:

```php
// Without ?-> (throws error if null)
$h->user->email  // Error: Attempt to read property on null

// With ?-> (returns null if object is null)
$h->performedBy?->email  // Returns null safely, no error
```

Combined with `??` (null coalescing), we can provide fallbacks:

```php
$h->performedBy?->full_name ?? $h->performedBy?->email ?? 'System'
```

This reads as:

1. Try to get full_name
2. If null, try to get email
3. If still null, use 'System'
