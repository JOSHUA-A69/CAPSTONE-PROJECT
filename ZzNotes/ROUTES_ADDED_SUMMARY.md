## 🔐 Security Features

All routes are protected with:

-   ✅ **Authentication** (`auth` middleware)
-   ✅ **Email verification** (`verified` middleware)
-   ✅ **Role-based access** (`RoleMiddleware` with specific role)
-   ✅ **CSRF protection** (automatically applied to POST routes)

---

## 🧪 How to Test the Routes

### Option 1: Use Artisan Route List

```bash
# View all reservation routes
php artisan route:list --path=reservations

# View specific role routes
php artisan route:list --path=requestor
php artisan route:list --path=adviser
php artisan route:list --path=admin/reservations
php artisan route:list --path=staff/reservations
php artisan route:list --path=priest
```

### Option 2: Access in Browser

Once you create the views, you can access:

-   **Requestor**: http://your-domain/requestor/reservations
-   **Adviser**: http://your-domain/adviser/reservations
-   **Admin**: http://your-domain/admin/reservations
-   **Staff**: http://your-domain/staff/reservations
-   **Priest**: http://your-domain/priest/reservations

---

## 📝 Route Naming Convention

All routes follow Laravel's standard naming:

```
{role}.reservations.{action}

Examples:
- requestor.reservations.index
- adviser.reservations.approve
- admin.reservations.assign-priest
- priest.reservations.confirm
```

This makes them easy to use in Blade templates:

```blade
<a href="{{ route('requestor.reservations.index') }}">My Reservations</a>
<form action="{{ route('adviser.reservations.approve', $reservation->reservation_id) }}" method="POST">
```

---

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. ✅ Routes are registered
2. ✅ Controllers are connected
3. ✅ Middleware protection is active
4. ✅ All CRUD operations are available
5. ✅ Role-based access control is enforced

---

## ⏳ What You Still Need to Do

### Next Step: Create the Blade Views

You need to create the view files that these routes will display. Here's the minimum you need:

**Requestor Views:**

```
resources/views/requestor/reservations/
├── index.blade.php    (list of reservations)
├── create.blade.php   (reservation form)
└── show.blade.php     (reservation details)
```

**Adviser Views:**

```
resources/views/adviser/reservations/
├── index.blade.php    (pending approvals list)
└── show.blade.php     (approve/reject interface)
```

**Admin Views:**

```
resources/views/admin/reservations/
├── index.blade.php    (all reservations list)
└── show.blade.php     (priest assignment dropdown)
```

**Staff Views:**

```
resources/views/staff/reservations/
├── index.blade.php      (all reservations)
├── show.blade.php       (details)
└── unnoticed.blade.php  (unnoticed requests)
```

**Priest Views:**

```
resources/views/priest/reservations/
├── index.blade.php    (assignments list)
├── show.blade.php     (confirm/decline interface)
└── calendar.blade.php (schedule calendar)
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

To verify routes are working, try visiting a route in your browser (you'll get an error about missing views, which is expected):

```
http://localhost/requestor/reservations
```

Expected result: Error saying "View [requestor.reservations.index] not found"
✅ This means the route is working! You just need to create the view.

## 📚 Using Routes in Your Views

### In Navigation Links

```blade
<!-- Requestor Dashboard -->
<a href="{{ route('requestor.reservations.index') }}">My Reservations</a>
<a href="{{ route('requestor.reservations.create') }}">New Reservation</a>

<!-- Adviser Dashboard -->
<a href="{{ route('adviser.reservations.index') }}">Pending Approvals</a>

<!-- Admin Dashboard -->
<a href="{{ route('admin.reservations.index') }}">All Reservations</a>

<!-- Priest Dashboard -->
<a href="{{ route('priest.reservations.index') }}">My Assignments</a>
<a href="{{ route('priest.calendar') }}">My Calendar</a>
```

### In Forms

```blade
<!-- Approve Form -->
<form action="{{ route('adviser.reservations.approve', $reservation->reservation_id) }}" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <button type="submit">Approve</button>
</form>

<!-- Assign Priest Form -->
<form action="{{ route('admin.reservations.assign-priest', $reservation->reservation_id) }}" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <select name="officiant_id">
        @foreach($availablePriests as $priest)
            <option value="{{ $priest->id }}">{{ $priest->full_name }}</option>
