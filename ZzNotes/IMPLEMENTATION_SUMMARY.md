## 📝 Next Steps for You

### 1. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Add to `.env`:

```env
# Email (if not already configured)
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=cream@hnu.edu.ph
MAIL_FROM_NAME="CREaM - HNU"

# SMS Configuration
SMS_ENABLED=true
SEMAPHORE_API_KEY=your_key
SEMAPHORE_SENDER_NAME=CREaM-HNU
```

### 3. Add Routes to web.php

Copy the route definitions from the documentation file and add them to `routes/web.php`.

### 4. Create Blade Views

You'll need to create the dashboard views for each role. The controllers are ready and expecting these views:

**Requestor Views:**

-   `resources/views/requestor/reservations/index.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/requestor/reservations/create.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/requestor/reservations/show.blade.php`

**Adviser Views:**

-   `resources/views/adviser/reservations/index.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/adviser/reservations/show.blade.php`

**Admin Views:**

-   `resources/views/admin/reservations/index.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/admin/reservations/show.blade.php`

**Staff Views:**

-   `resources/views/staff/reservations/index.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/staff/reservations/show.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/staff/reservations/unnoticed.blade.php`

**Priest Views:**

-   `resources/views/priest/reservations/index.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/priest/reservations/show.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/priest/reservations/calendar.blade.php`

### 5. Set Up Cron Job (Production Server)

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### 6. Test the System

```bash
# Test unnoticed requests detection (dry run)
php artisan reservations:check-unnoticed

# Test with actual notifications
php artisan reservations:check-unnoticed --send-notifications
```

## 🎨 Design Considerations

### For Frontend Views

-   Use responsive design (Bootstrap/Tailwind)
-   Show clear status badges
-   Include action buttons based on role and status
-   Display notification indicators
-   Show timeline/history for reservations

### Priest Assignment Dropdown

Should show:

-   ✅ Priest name
-   ✅ Availability status (available/unavailable)
-   ❌ Disable unavailable priests
-   Show conflict information

### Status Badges

```
pending → Yellow/Warning
adviser_approved → Blue/Info
admin_approved → Purple
approved → Green/Success
rejected → Red/Danger
cancelled → Gray
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Testing**: Use `SMS_ENABLED=false` during development to avoid SMS charges
2. **Email Testing**: Use Mailtrap or MailHog for local testing
3. **Logs**: Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for notification issues
4. **Database**: Use database transactions in controllers for data integrity
