# Priest Cancel Confirmed Reservation Feature - Complete ✅

## Feature Overview

Priests can now **cancel their already-confirmed reservations** (not just decline assignments before confirming). This provides flexibility if they encounter emergencies or unavoidable conflicts after confirmation.

---

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **Controller Logic Updates**

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Priest/ReservationController.php`

#### Enhanced `decline()` Method

-   ✅ Now handles BOTH scenarios:
    -   **Decline before confirmation** (existing)
    -   **Cancel after confirmation** (NEW)
-   ✅ Detects cancellation status: `$isCancellation = ($reservation->priest_confirmation === 'confirmed')`

-   ✅ Expanded status validation:

    ```php
    // Now allows: pending_priest_confirmation, admin_approved, AND approved (confirmed)
    if (!in_array($reservation->status, ['pending_priest_confirmation', 'admin_approved', 'approved']))
    ```

-   ✅ Different history actions:

    -   `priest_declined` - for unconfirmed assignments
    -   `priest_cancelled_confirmation` - for confirmed reservations (NEW)

-   ✅ Different notification messages based on type

---

### 2. **Notification Service**

**File**: `app/Services/ReservationNotificationService.php`

#### New Method: `notifyPriestCancelledConfirmation()`

```php
public function notifyPriestCancelledConfirmation(Reservation $reservation, string $reason, $priestId): void
```

**Features:**

-   ✅ Sends **URGENT** email to all admins/staff
-   ✅ Email subject: `⚠️ URGENT: {PriestName} Cancelled Confirmed Reservation #{ID}`
-   ✅ Creates in-app notifications with type: `'Urgent'`
-   ✅ Includes cancellation reason in email
-   ✅ Warning: "⚠️ This priest had already confirmed their availability but has now cancelled."
-   ✅ SMS alert to admins: "⚠️ URGENT: Please reassign immediately!"

---

### 3. **UI Enhancements**

**File**: `resources/views/priest/reservations/show.blade.php`

#### Added "Cancel My Confirmation" Section

-   ✅ Shows **only if**:

    -   Reservation is confirmed (`priest_confirmation === 'confirmed'`)
    -   Status is 'approved'
    -   Schedule date is in the future (`$reservation->schedule_date->isFuture()`)

-   ✅ Yellow warning box explaining the option
-   ✅ Red button: "Cancel My Confirmation"
-   ✅ Opens dedicated modal for cancellation

#### New Cancel Confirmation Modal

-   ✅ Warning icon and heading
-   ✅ Red alert box: "⚠️ You have already confirmed your availability. Cancelling now will require urgent reassignment."
-   ✅ Required reason textarea (different placeholder: "Emergency, Health issue, etc.")
-   ✅ Two buttons:
    -   "Keep My Confirmation" (cancel action)
    -   "Yes, Cancel Confirmation" (submit)

---
