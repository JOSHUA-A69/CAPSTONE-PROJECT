## üîç Technical Notes

-   Helps admin understand priority (who is waiting)
-   Makes reassignment easier (can contact requestor directly if needed)
-   Improves traceability and accountability

### Notification Type Strategy

-   **"Update"** for confirmations (positive, informational)
-   **"Urgent"** for cancellations (negative, requires action)
-   **"Priest Declined"** for initial declines (neutral, expected workflow)
