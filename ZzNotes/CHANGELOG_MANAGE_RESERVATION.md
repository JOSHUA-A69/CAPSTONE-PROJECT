## 🔄 Complete Workflow Implementation

### **Stage 1: Submission**

1. Requestor submits reservation via `ReservationController@store`
2. Sets `adviser_notified_at` timestamp
3. Creates history record: 'submitted'
4. Sends email to requestor (confirmation)
5. Sends email + SMS to adviser (new request)

### **Stage 2: Adviser Review**

1. Adviser views pending requests via `AdviserController@index`
2. System shows "unnoticed count" if >24h
3. Adviser clicks approve/reject
4. Sets `adviser_responded_at` timestamp
5. If approved:
    - Updates status to 'adviser_approved'
    - Sets `admin_notified_at` timestamp
    - Creates history: 'adviser_approved'
    - Sends email to requestor + admins
6. If rejected:
    - Updates status to 'rejected'
    - Creates history: 'adviser_rejected'
    - Sends email to requestor with reason

### **Stage 3: Admin Assignment**

1. Admin views approved requests via `AdminController@index`
2. Admin selects priest from dropdown
3. System checks for scheduling conflicts
4. If no conflict:
    - Sets `officiant_id` (priest)
    - Sets `priest_notified_at` timestamp
    - Sets `priest_confirmation` = 'pending'
    - Updates status to 'admin_approved'
    - Creates history: 'priest_assigned'
    - Sends email + SMS to priest
    - Sends email to requestor

### **Stage 4: Priest Confirmation**

1. Priest views assignments via `PriestController@index`
2. System shows "pending confirmation count"
3. Priest clicks confirm/decline
4. If confirmed:
    - Sets `priest_confirmation` = 'confirmed'
    - Sets `priest_confirmed_at` timestamp
    - Updates status to 'approved'
    - Creates history: 'priest_confirmed'
    - Sends final confirmation emails to all
5. If declined:
    - Sets `priest_confirmation` = 'declined'
    - Reverts status to 'adviser_approved'
    - Removes `officiant_id`
    - Creates history: 'priest_declined'
    - Sends email to admin for reassignment

### **Stage 5: Monitoring (Staff)**

1. Staff views all reservations via `StaffController@index`
2. Views unnoticed requests (>24h) via `unnoticed()`
3. Sends follow-up to adviser via `sendFollowUp()`
4. Rate limit: 1 follow-up per 24h
5. Creates history: 'staff_followed_up'

### **Stage 6: Automated Monitoring**

1. Cron runs daily at 9:00 AM
2. Command: `reservations:check-unnoticed --send-notifications`
3. Finds reservations pending >24h
4. Sends follow-up email + SMS to advisers
5. Sends notification to staff
6. Updates `staff_followed_up_at` timestamp

### **Edge Case: Cancellation**

1. Requestor/Staff can cancel reservation
2. Requires cancellation reason
3. Sets `cancellation_reason` and `cancelled_by`
4. Updates status to 'cancelled'
5. Creates history: 'cancelled'
6. Sends email to all involved parties:
    - Requestor
    - Adviser
    - Admin
    - Priest (if assigned)

// Priest dashboard
$pendingCount = Reservation::forPriest($priestId)
    ->where('priest_confirmation', 'pending')
    ->count();
```

### **Date Formatting**

```php
$reservation->created_at->diffForHumans() // "2 days ago"

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Role-Based Access Control**

    - RoleMiddleware checks user role
    - Each controller only accessible by correct role

2. **Ownership Validation**

    - Advisers can only approve their organization's requests
    - Priests can only confirm their own assignments
    - Requestors can only cancel their own reservations

3. **Status Validation**

    - Each action validates current status
    - Prevents invalid state transitions

4. **Input Validation**

    - All user inputs validated
    - Required fields enforced
    - Date must be in future
    - Reason required for rejection/cancellation

5. **Rate Limiting**

    - Follow-ups limited to 1 per 24h per reservation

6. **Conflict Detection**
    - Prevents double-booking priests
    - ±2 hour buffer check
