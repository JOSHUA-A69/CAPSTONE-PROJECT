# Priest Decline Notification System - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 18, 2025

## Overview

Implemented a notification system that alerts administrators when a priest declines a reservation assignment, enabling them to quickly reassign another presider to the service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Mailable Class

**File:** `app/Mail/ReservationPriestDeclined.php`

-   New email notification class for priest decline events
-   Includes reservation details, decline reason, and priest information
-   Configured to send to CREaM administrators

### 2. Created Email Template

**File:** `resources/views/emails/reservations/priest-declined.blade.php`

-   Professional email template with clear alert styling (red theme)
-   Displays complete reservation information
-   Shows the reason for decline
-   Includes direct action button to view reservation and assign new priest
-   Provides step-by-step next actions for admins

### 3. Updated ReservationNotificationService

**File:** `app/Services/ReservationNotificationService.php`

Added new method: `notifyPriestDeclined(Reservation $reservation, string $reason)`

Features:

-   Sends email to all admin and staff users
-   Sends SMS to the first available admin/staff with phone number
-   Email includes full reservation details and decline reason
-   SMS provides urgent notification with reservation ID and date

### 4. Updated Priest ReservationController

**File:** `app/Http\Controllers\Priest\ReservationController.php`

Modified the `decline()` method:

-   Uncommented the notification service call
-   Now actively sends notifications when a priest declines
-   Maintains all existing functionality (status updates, history tracking, etc.)

## Workflow After Priest Decline

1. **Priest declines assignment** via the system with a reason
2. **System automatically:**
    - Updates reservation status to `pending_priest_reassignment`
    - Clears the `officiant_id` (removes priest assignment)
    - Records decline in `priest_declines` table
    - Creates history entry with action `priest_declined`
3. **Admin/Staff receive notifications:**
    - Email with full details and action button
    - SMS alert (if phone number available)
4. **Admin can now:**
    - Click the link in email to view reservation
    - Assign a new priest through the admin interface
    - New priest will receive assignment notification

## Database Context

### Reservation Status

-   Status changes to: `pending_priest_reassignment`
-   This distinguishes it from other pending states

1. **Email Testing:**

    - Have a priest decline a reservation
    - Verify admin receives email with correct information
    - Test email link to reservation page
    - Verify email styling and formatting

2. **SMS Testing:**

    - Ensure SMS configuration is set up in `config/services.php`
    - Add phone number to an admin user
    - Test SMS delivery after priest decline

3. **Workflow Testing:**
    - Verify status changes to `pending_priest_reassignment`
    - Confirm officiant_id is cleared
    - Check decline is recorded in priest_declines table
    - Verify admin can assign new priest
