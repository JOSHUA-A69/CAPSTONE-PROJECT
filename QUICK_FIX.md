# ✅ FIXED: Missing performedBy Relationship

## What Was Wrong

The error you saw:

```
Call to undefined relationship [performedBy] on model [App\Models\ReservationHistory]
```

This happened because the `ReservationHistory` model was missing the `performedBy()` relationship method.

## What I Fixed

**File:** `app/Models/ReservationHistory.php`

**Added this relationship:**

```php
public function performedBy()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'performed_by', 'id');
}
```

This connects the `performed_by` column in the `reservation_history` table to the `id` column in the `users` table, so you can access who performed each action on a reservation.

## How to Apply the Fix

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Method 1: Clear Laravel caches
docker exec laravel_app php artisan cache:clear
docker exec laravel_app php artisan config:clear

# Method 2: Restart the container (if above doesn't work)
docker restart laravel_app
docker start laravel_app
```

Then refresh your browser:

-   Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
-   Try accessing the reservation page again

## Test It

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:8000/staff/reservations
2. **Click on any reservation** to view details
3. **It should now work!** ✅

The history section will now properly show who performed each action on the reservation.

## What This Relationship Does

Now you can use:

```php
$history = ReservationHistory::find(1);
$user = $history->performedBy;  // Gets the User who performed the action
echo $user->full_name;          // Shows the user's name
```

This is used in the reservation show page to display who performed each action in the history log.
